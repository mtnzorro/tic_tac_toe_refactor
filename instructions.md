# TicTacToe Challenge

Here is a `tictactoe` function that returns the winner given a board. Try to refactor or rewrite the function in the most simple, clean, and elegant way. I have provided a test suite for this code, so that you can run the tests to quickly check if your solution works correctly.

## Running the test suite

To run the test suite, first install jasmine-node

```
npm install jasmine-node -g
```

Then, run

```
jasmine-node
```
